Introduction

This README provides instructions on how to set up your Windows system for running Python web applications using Flask. It includes steps for installing the necessary libraries, running Python scripts using an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like Visual Studio Code, and verifying the outputs through a web browser.

Prerequisites
- Windows Operating System
- Python installed (Python 3.x is recommended)
- An IDE (e.g., Visual Studio Code)

Installation

1. Open a Command Prompt window as an Administrator.
2. Install the required Python libraries by executing the following commands:
   pip install flask
   pip install flask-restful
   pip install flask-sqlalchemy
These commands will install Flask, a micro web framework for Python, Flask-RESTful for building REST APIs easily, and Flask-SQLAlchemy which is an extension for Flask that adds support for SQLAlchemy.

Running the Tasks

Task 1: BIA_1.py
1. Open your IDE and load the file `BIA_1.py`.
2. Run the script by using the IDE's run command.
3. After the script is running, open any web browser.
4. In the search bar, type `127.0.0.1:5000/hello` and press Enter.
5. You should see the output as per the assignment.
6. A screenshot of this output can be found in the project files.

Task 2: BIA_2.py
1. Open your IDE and load the file `BIA_2.py`.
2. Run the script.
3. Open any web browser.
4. In the search bar, type `127.0.0.1:5000` and press Enter to see the output.
5. Next, type `127.0.0.1:5000/addition/30` and press Enter to view the result.
6. The results generated should be according to the assignment.
7. Screenshots of these outputs are available in the project files.

Task 3: BIA_3.py
1. Open your IDE and load the file `BIA_3.py`.
2. Run the script.
3. Open any web browser.
4. In the search bar, type `127.0.0.1:5000` and press Enter to see the output.
5. To see the output for the register function, type `127.0.0.1:5000/register` and press Enter.
6. To see the output for the user function, type `127.0.0.1:5000/user` and press Enter.
7. All results should be consistent with the assignment requirements.
8. Screenshots for these outputs are also included in the project files.
